          <div class="founders-address">
            <p>Chess in Slums was established in 2018 when Tunde Onakoya, the convener conceived the idea on how the game of chess can be used to lift indigent children out of the endless loop of poverty and societal denigration.</p>
            <img src="./chessimgs/mr ibrahim.jpg"  id="pic">
          </div>
          <p id="resize">Coming from an economically disadvantaged background, Tunde saw no way out until the game of chess came to his rescue. Since then, he envisioned a world where like him, the game of chess will be the ultimate messiah that impoverished children need to envision a world beyond their grim reality.</p>
          <p id="resize">At Chess in slums, we believe every child deserves an equal opportunity in attaining a better life. This belief is what led us to adopt an innovative approach where we use the game of chess to empower children from impoverished backgrounds to learn academic, educational, and critical thinking skills that will help them secure a better tomorrow.Our ultimate goal is to train over 1 million Children in the space of 5 years.</p>

        <div class="our-impact">
          <div class="our-impact-con1">
            <p>For Tunde, using the game of chess as a social development tool was never an option, it was the only choice.

              This vision which birthed Chess in Slums have resulted in immeasurable impact that have elevated the status of indigent children in getting a better life. As a result of using chess as a tool for socioeconomic transformation, we have succeeded in securing lifelong scholarships for over 200 Children from indigent homes.</p>

            <p>We have partnered with international,domestic and governmental bodies, companies, celebrities, organizations, and institutions to help further our course.Chess in slum Africa is still expanding its programming to different parts of the world,becoming a greater part of the community, and continuing to partner and work with leaders in our field of work.</p>

        <p id="resize">Achieving our goals and impacts demand us to go into the trenches and places that are otherwise avoided, this strategy has consistently set us apart from the crowd. For us, it is about giving every child a chance at meaningful survival. That irrespective of whatever background they come from, they are the future leaders tomorrow needs.</p>
        <div class="founders-address">
          <p>our-identity We found a unique approach in one of the exceptional principles of the game of chess. Just like the Pawn, which is often considered the weakest Chess piece, can be promoted into a Queen – the most powerful Chessman when it reaches the 8th rank, we believe every child can be elevated from their disadvantaged and weak position. Therefore, for us at College Chess, we act as that bridge that</p>
